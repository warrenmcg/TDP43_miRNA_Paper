# Fatiscan Output Files

The files in this directory were downloaded directly from the Babelomics website.

One job was run for each dataset (`LUAD`, `LUSC`), found in their respective directories.

In order for **step 8** to work correctly, these need to be moved to the `LUAD_data` and `LUSC_data`
directories.

The main file used for downstream steps is `your_annotation.txt` which contains the results from
`Fatiscan` for all of the miRNAs.
