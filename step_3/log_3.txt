Running DESeq2 on the mRNA isoform counts
[1] "Finishing set-up..."
converting counts to integer mode
estimating size factors
estimating dispersions
gene-wise dispersion estimates: 8 workers
mean-dispersion relationship
final dispersion estimates, MLE betas: 8 workers
fitting model and testing: 8 workers
-- replacing outliers and refitting for 9160 genes
-- DESeq argument 'minReplicatesForReplace' = 7 
-- original counts are preserved in counts(dds)
estimating dispersions
fitting model and testing
